# PRISM: Mission and Purpose

## What PRISM Is

PRISM is a **geometric analysis system** designed to detect, measure, and validate **persistent structure** in complex data over time.

It does not predict outcomes.
It does not assign meaning.
It does not impose narratives.

PRISM answers a simpler, harder question:

> **What geometric relationships consistently exist in this system, and which ones are noise?**

---

## What Problem PRISM Solves

Most analytical systems today focus on:
- individual indicators
- correlations at a point in time
- model outputs tied to specific assumptions

These approaches struggle to answer:
- Which relationships are *stable* versus *accidental*?
- Which structures persist across time, scale, and method?
- Which patterns survive noise, perturbation, and re-measurement?

PRISM addresses this gap by treating data as a **geometric system**, not just a collection of variables.

---

## Core Design Principle

PRISM separates **measurement** from **interpretation**.

- The system measures structure.
- The user interprets meaning.

This separation is intentional and foundational.

PRISM does **not** tell the user what to believe.
It shows what **persists**.

## The PRISM Data Lifecycle

PRISM enforces a strict, transparent pipeline:

### 1. RAW

- External facts as observed or reported
- Stored permanently
- Never overwritten
- Append-only history

RAW answers:

> *What happened?*

---

### 2. DATA

- Structured organization of raw inputs
- Aligned, indexed, and formatted
- No alteration of truth

DATA answers:

> *How are facts arranged?*

---

### 3. CLEAN

- Explicit, documented preparation
- Forward-filling, interpolation, smoothing, normalization
- Every modification is declared

CLEAN answers:

> *How was reality prepared for analysis?*

Clean data is **transient** and regenerable.

---

### 4. GEOMETRIC COMPONENTS

Measured properties of structure, including but not limited to:
- distances
- angles
- directions
- curvature
- coherence
- cycles
- dominant modes
- clustering and separation

These are **measurements**, not interpretations.

GEOMETRIC COMPONENTS answer:

> *What structural properties exist locally?*

---

### 5. SYNTHETIC GEOMETRY

This is where PRISM stores **asserted structure**.

Synthetic geometry represents:
- shapes
- manifolds
- regimes
- state spaces
- trajectories
- boundaries

Synthetic data is:
- persistent
- versioned
- replaceable
- comparable across time

Synthetic geometry answers:

> *Which structures appear consistently enough to be treated as real within the system?*

---

## What PRISM Produces

PRISM produces **evidence of structure**, not conclusions.

Specifically, it demonstrates:
- which geometric shapes persist across time windows
- which structures survive changes in resolution
- which patterns are robust to noise and perturbation
- which relationships appear transient or unstable

PRISM distinguishes:

> **consistent structure** versus **noise**

---

## What PRISM Is Not

PRISM is not:
- a forecasting engine
- a trading system
- a medical diagnostic tool
- a policy recommendation system
- a narrative generator

PRISM does not claim:
- truth
- causality
- optimality
- correctness of interpretation

Those decisions belong to the user.

---

## Role of the Developer

The developer (architect) of PRISM is responsible for:
- building accurate measurement tools
- enforcing data integrity
- separating computation from belief
- preserving historical structure
- preventing interpretive leakage into the system

The developer is **not** responsible for:
- how results are used
- what conclusions are drawn
- which domain is most compelling

---

## Role of the User

The user applies PRISM to:
- financial systems
- ecological systems
- climate systems
- biological systems
- social systems
- any complex, time-evolving domain

PRISM provides structure.
The user provides meaning.

---

## Why PRISM Exists

PRISM exists because current methods:
- collapse measurement and interpretation
- overwrite history with new beliefs
- confuse transient correlations with structure

PRISM preserves:
- truth
- uncertainty
- evolution of understanding

It allows systems to **learn without lying about their past**.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

> **PRISM is a system for detecting and validating persistent geometric structure in complex data over time, separating what consistently exists from what is noise, while leaving interpretation to the user.**

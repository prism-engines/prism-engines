# PRISM NEXT STEPS (Planned)

## Immediate (Next Session)
1. Geometry Visualization
   - PCA / UMAP over geometry vectors
   - Visual confirmation of clusters & sparsity

2. Temporal Frequency Engine
   - FFT / wavelet-based
   - Capture cyclical structure missing from current engines

3. Engine Scoring
   - Track which engines reduce sparsity most
   - Quantify engine contribution value

## Short-Term
4. Cross-Domain Data
   - Non-market systems (climate, supply chain, biology)
   - Validate geometry universality

5. Agent Memory Upgrade
   - Persist proposal acceptance / rejection
   - Avoid re-proposing solved math gaps

## Medium-Term
6. Research Mode
   - Treat geometry vectors as primary objects
   - Engines become probes into system structure

7. Publication-Grade Outputs
   - Geometry maps
   - Engine contribution charts
   - Sparsity evolution over time

# PersistencePolicy Configuration
# Agent: temporal_persistence_agent.py
# Purpose: Temporal persistence and regime transition thresholds
#
# All values here are the EXACT defaults from the hardcoded PersistencePolicy dataclass.
# Changing these values WILL change agent behavior.

version: "1.0.0"

# Transition detection
# A step distance > mean + (transition_threshold * std) is a transition
transition_threshold: 1.5  # std devs from mean step size
min_transition_confidence: 0.3

# Persistence thresholds
high_persistence_threshold: 0.7
low_persistence_threshold: 0.3

# Continuity thresholds
# A step distance > mean + (discontinuity_threshold * std) is a discontinuity
discontinuity_threshold: 3.0  # std devs for discontinuity

# Fraction of data to check for edge effects (boundary artifacts)
edge_window_fraction: 0.1

# Regime analysis
min_regime_duration_days: 30

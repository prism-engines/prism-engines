# MultiViewGeometryAgent Configuration
# Agent: agent_multiview_geometry.py
# Purpose: View-aware geometry score adjustments
#
# All values here are the EXACT defaults from the hardcoded VIEW_SCORE_ADJUSTMENTS dict.
# Changing these values WILL change agent behavior.

# View score adjustments
# These reflect structural properties of each data transformation.
# v3 geometry agent was designed for LEVEL data - other views need rebalancing.
#
# Format: view_type -> geometry -> adjustment_multiplier
# - Values > 1.0 boost that geometry's score
# - Values < 1.0 demote that geometry's score
# - Values = 1.0 leave unchanged

view_score_adjustments:
  level:
    # Level view: v3 designed for this, all compete fairly
    latent_flow: 1.0
    coupled_oscillator: 1.0
    reflexive_stochastic: 1.0
    pure_noise: 1.0

  returns:
    # Returns are stationary by construction
    # Latent_flow diagnostics (saturation, S-curve) are structurally inapplicable
    latent_flow: 0.2           # Strongly demote - inapplicable
    coupled_oscillator: 0.5    # Demote - differencing obscures cycles
    reflexive_stochastic: 1.2  # Boost slightly - this is where reflexivity shows
    pure_noise: 1.0            # Fair baseline

  volatility:
    # Volatility is second-order structure
    # Reflexive patterns (clustering, persistence) are primary signal
    latent_flow: 0.4           # Demote
    coupled_oscillator: 0.7    # Slightly demote
    reflexive_stochastic: 1.3  # Boost - vol clustering is reflexive signature
    pure_noise: 1.0            # Fair baseline

  deviation:
    # Deviation from MA is mean-reverting by construction
    # Oscillator patterns should dominate
    latent_flow: 0.3           # Demote - can't accumulate around mean
    coupled_oscillator: 1.4    # Boost - mean reversion is oscillatory
    reflexive_stochastic: 0.8  # Slight demote
    pure_noise: 1.0            # Fair baseline

  anomaly:
    # Climate anomalies - similar to deviation
    latent_flow: 0.5
    coupled_oscillator: 1.2
    reflexive_stochastic: 0.9
    pure_noise: 1.0

  incidence:
    # Epidemiology incidence (new cases)
    # Latent_flow still applicable (epidemic curves)
    latent_flow: 1.0
    coupled_oscillator: 0.8
    reflexive_stochastic: 1.1
    pure_noise: 1.0

# View weights for consensus arbitration
view_weights:
  level: 0.30
  returns: 0.35
  volatility: 0.25
  deviation: 0.30
  anomaly: 0.30
  incidence: 0.35

# AgreementPolicy Configuration
# Agent: cross_engine_agreement_agent.py
# Purpose: Cross-engine agreement thresholds
#
# All values here are the EXACT defaults from the hardcoded AgreementPolicy dataclass.
# Changing these values WILL change agent behavior.

version: "1.0.0"

# Agreement thresholds (correlation-based)
reinforcing_threshold: 0.3    # Correlation above this = reinforcing
contradicting_threshold: -0.3  # Correlation below this = contradicting

# Contradiction severity thresholds (std devs)
low_disagreement: 1.0
medium_disagreement: 2.0
high_disagreement: 3.0

# Confidence adjustment multipliers
high_agreement_bonus: 1.2     # Applied when agreement_score > 0.7 and no contradictions
contradiction_penalty: 0.8    # Applied when any contradicting pairs exist

[View your SQL helper](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/prism_sql_helper.py)

Drop that in your `Start/` folder. 

Once the database exists, you can either:

**Option 1: Import in your scripts**
```python
from prism_sql_helper import connect, top_indicators, indicator_history

conn = connect()
df = top_indicators(conn, window_start=2005)
```

**Option 2: Run standalone**
```bash
python prism_sql_helper.py
```
Opens interactive mode with instructions.

**Option 3: Use DB Browser**
Just open the `.db` file visually, click around, run queries in the GUI.

Let me know when Claude Code finishes the temporal runner - we can test everything together.

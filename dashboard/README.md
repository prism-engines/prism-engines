# PRISM Dashboard (Initial Skeleton)

This folder provides the foundation for the interactive PRISM dashboard:

- Flask backend (`app.py`)
- Tabler UI (`templates/`)
- Placeholder UI controls for diagnostics, fetch, analysis, ML/Meta, systems
- Output viewer

This version is UI-only and safe. No PRISM engine code is touched.

Run locally with:

```
cd dashboard
python app.py
```
